Recently, I learned of Volkswagen's new concept car, the Sedric, which is basically a display stand for the new technologies that they are working on.

It looks very nice... except for the front, which looks idiotic. (I haven't seen the back yet.)

So I made this.

Or perhaps 'coded' would be a better word.

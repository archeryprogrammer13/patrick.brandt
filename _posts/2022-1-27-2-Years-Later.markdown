Well Heck.

I guess I got sidetracked?

I said I was going to post about Campion stuff and Blender stuff, and there's been plenty of that sort of stuff to post about, but I haven't posted about it.

I also forgot how blog posts worked, but I think I've figured it out.

The past couple of days I've been going full hacker mode on customising every customisable part of my computer's operating system, as well as some uncustomisable parts, so I guess I was kind of in the mood for coding stuff and that's why I suddenly have the motivation to write a blog post.

Might start posting more often now that I'm not spending 70% of my day surfing YouTube thanks to Exodus 90.

On the other hand...

With my now extensive life experience of not getting around to things, I am well aware that I can't make any promises in that regard.

Will my posting frequency improve?

Only time will tell...
